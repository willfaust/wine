/***********************************************************************
 *   iOS-Madeira ml952: the in-process event fast path ("fastsync")
 *
 * The wineserver is a thread in this same Mach task, so every event_op and
 * every single-object wait is a socket write, two scheduler hops and a socket
 * write back: [srv-stats] on log 41 measured 50 us per request, 2900 event ops
 * and 900 single-object waits a second, all of it between the 32-bit title's
 * main thread and its render/worker threads -- about 150 us of latency on each
 * handoff between the two threads that pace the frame.
 *
 * Upstream already has the shape of the fix: the inproc_set_event() /
 * inproc_wait() hooks above, which on Linux push the operation into
 * /dev/ntsync and never reach the server.  They are dead here
 * (inproc_device_fd < 0).  This is the iOS substitute, and it exploits the one
 * thing this port has that upstream does not: the server's own object state is
 * at an address this thread can read.  Each handle-reachable event gets a cell
 * (build/ntdll-unix/shims/ios_fastsync.h) whose state word IS the event state
 * -- the server's event_sync_signaled()/_satisfied() read and clear the same
 * word -- so a set or a wait can be a compare-and-swap plus, at most, one
 * os_sync_wake_by_address.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT fast-pathed, because the server is still the only
 * thing that can do it correctly:
 *   - alertable waits, wait-all, and any wait on more than one handle;
 *   - NtSignalAndWaitForSingleObject and keyed events;
 *   - PulseEvent, which takes its event out of the fast path for good;
 *   - a set on an event that has a server-side waiter, which still issues the
 *     event_op request so the server wakes its own queue (the cell update
 *     happens first either way, so the request's reply is ignored).
 * And a fast wait is capped at ~2 ms and then falls through to the real
 * server_wait, so APCs, alerts, suspension and thread termination are never
 * delayed by more than that cap.

 *
 * MADEIRA_FAST_SPIN is an ITERATION count with no clock in it, so what it
 * actually buys depends on the core it lands on and on nothing else.  On a
 * P-core 96 `isb`s is a few microseconds; the kprev5 gameplay capture shows
 * `__ulock_wait2<-madeira_fast_wait` at 4.5 % of all CPU with busy=1.37 of
 * six cores, i.e. a job system handing work between cores thousands of times
 * a frame on a machine that is four fifths idle, paying a park and a wake for
 * handoffs that were often microseconds away.  A park costs two syscalls, a
 * context switch out and a scheduler wake-up in; on an idle machine spinning
 * for tens of microseconds is unambiguously cheaper, and on a busy one it is
 * unambiguously worse.  So the budget cannot be a constant -- it has to be a
 * function of whether spinning has been paying.
 *
 * The controller is deliberately the simplest thing that self-limits:
 *   credit starts at MAX and the budget is spin_ns * credit / MAX;
 *   a timed spin that was SATISFIED adds MADEIRA_SPIN_CREDIT_UP,
 *   a timed spin that had to park subtracts one.
 * Steady state: the timed spin survives as long as at least 1 in
 * (UP + 1) = 1 in 3 of them pay off, and decays to nothing -- one clock read
 * per wait -- when they do not.  That is the "are there spare cores" question
 * answered by measurement instead of by sampling host_statistics(), which
 * would cost a syscall to learn something the payoff rate already implies.
 *
 * The budget is additionally clamped to the caller's own remaining timeout by
 * the same rule the park already uses, so a 30 us WaitForSingleObject can
 * never be turned into a 60 us one.
 *
 * MADEIRA_FASTSYNC_SPIN_US=0 removes the timed phase entirely and restores
 * exactly the pre-ml1050 ladder. */

 * right ceiling rather than 10 or 200: at 8 us only a quarter of parks would be
 * caught, and past 128 us the marginal park costs more spin than it saves.
 *
 * THE PROBE.  One park in MADEIRA_SPIN_PROBE_EVERY spins anyway, on a budget of the
 * ceiling shifted down, and is scored by the ordinary hit/miss path.  A single hit
 * lifts credit off 0 and the existing controller takes over; a run of misses leaves
 * it at 0 because the decrement is clamped there.  Cost at the measured park rate is
 * ~580 probes per ten seconds at 5 us each -- under 3 ms of spin spread across every

 * `e->handle' (a plain STR) before the STLR that marks the entry as being

 * live event, so its gen still matches the old gen that was read with it.
 *
 * The consequence is exactly the reported failure signature: NtWaitForSingle-
 * Object( B ) returns STATUS_SUCCESS the moment some unrelated event A is set
 * (and NtSetEvent( B ) sets A), so the waiter runs before its producer has
 * published anything and reads a pointer that is still NULL.  It needs no
 * pathological program -- just two threads, one learning a handle into a slot
 * while another looks the same slot up, which is what "a worker starts a new
 * thread and both touch the same events" does.

/***********************************************************************
 *   ml982: THE WATCHDOG -- a hang becomes a logged hiccup
 *
 * WHERE A HANG CAN ACTUALLY LIVE.  The fast path parks for at most
 * madeira_fast_cap_ns (2 ms, 50 ms at the top of the knob's range) and then
 * hands the wait to the server, so "parked on a cell for two seconds" is not a
 * state this code can reach.  A thread that is stuck is stuck in server_wait,
 * and once it is there only the server can wake it.  So the watchdog cannot
 * live in the park loop: it has to live in the fall-through, and the way to
 * give an INFINITE wait a heartbeat is to stop making it infinite.
 *
 * WHAT IT LOOKS FOR.  Both sides read the same word, so they cannot disagree
 * about RESET vs SET by opinion -- only by accident.  The one observable
 * accident is: the server has just evaluated this object and said NOT
 * SIGNALED, while the cell says SET.  That is a token nobody can collect: the
 * wake that should have followed the set was lost, or the set landed on a cell
 * that is no longer the one the server is reading.  Either way this thread
 * would wait forever.
 *
 * WHY THE SECOND OPINION.  A plain "the timed wait expired and the cell says
 * SET" is a false positive whenever the set simply landed in the gap between
 * the two.  So the check re-asks the server with a ZERO-timeout select, which
 * is both the confirmation and the cure when there is nothing wrong: if the
 * object really is signaled the server satisfies the wait there and then and
 * the caller gets its STATUS_SUCCESS.  Only "server says no AND the cell still
 * says SET" is reported.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES ABOUT IT.  One log line per process, a counter for the rest,
 * and MADEIRA_EVENT_OP_DISABLE on that one object -- the PulseEvent exit,
 * which folds the cell state back into the server's own bit, wakes every
 * parked client and makes every future operation on that event take the server
 * path.  A false positive therefore costs one permanently slower event and
 * nothing else, which is the right price for never hanging.
 *
 * COST ON THE HOT PATH: none.  This runs only for an INFINITE single-object
 * wait that the wake path could not satisfy, only when the wake path is
 * active, and then once per interval per parked thread -- and the interval
 * backs off ×4 to a minute, so a worker idle for an hour costs about 60
 * requests, against the 338000 per 10 s this mechanism exists to remove.

/* The INFINITE single-object wait, with a heartbeat.  Used only when the wake
 * path is live; otherwise the caller issues the plain infinite server_wait it
 * always did.
 *
 * ml1060: IT NOW COVERS ALERTABLE WAITS TOO, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
 *
 * Through ml1050 both callers gated this on `!alertable', alongside the gate on
 * madeira_fast_wait() -- which genuinely does need it, because a thread parked
 * on a futex cell cannot notice a queued user APC.  The heartbeat needs no such
 * thing: every iteration is an ordinary server_wait with the caller's own
 * `flags' (SELECT_ALERTABLE included), so an APC still comes back as
 * STATUS_USER_APC and is returned to the caller unchanged; the ONLY difference
 * from a single infinite wait is that a wait which has produced nothing for
 * `ms' is re-asked.
 *
 * What the gate cost is measurable in a device log: k67, a managed-runtime
 * title whose worker waits are all `WaitForSingleObjectEx( h, INFINITE, TRUE )',
 * shows `select: w1 inf=56429' per 10 s -- 56429 infinite single-object waits
 * that reached the server with timeout == NULL, i.e. that never entered this
 * function -- together with `watchdog=3(8)' and `desync=0(0)'.  desync=0 there
 * is not evidence of health: it is evidence that the detector was switched off
 * for every thread that could hang.  The same gate is why `sem_wait=0(4)' and
 * `pollpeek=0(1)': an alertable wait sees none of this mechanism.  The wake
 * path and the peek keep the gate (a peek answering STATUS_TIMEOUT would skip
 * the STATUS_USER_APC an alertable zero-timeout wait owes its caller); the
 * heartbeat, which always goes to the server, does not. */

/* It's possible for synchronization primitives to remain alive even after being
 * closed, because a thread is still waiting on them. It's rare in practice, and
 * documented as being undefined behaviour by Microsoft, but it works, and some
 * applications rely on it. This means we need to refcount handles, and defer
 * deleting them on the server side until the refcount reaches zero. We do this
 * by having each client process hold a handle to the in-process synchronization
 * object, as well as a private refcount. When the client refcount reaches zero,
 * it closes the handle; when all handles are closed, the server deletes the
 * in-process synchronization object.
 *
 * We also need this for signal-and-wait. The signal and wait operations aren't
 * atomic, but we can't perform the signal and then return STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE
 * for the wait—we need to either do both operations or neither. That means we
 * need to grab references to both objects, and prevent them from being
 * destroyed before we're done with them.
 *
 * We want lookup of objects from the cache to be very fast; ideally, it should
 * be lock-free. We achieve this by using atomic modifications to "refcount",
 * and guaranteeing that all other fields are valid and correct *as long as*
 * refcount is nonzero, and we store the entire structure in memory which will
 * never be freed.
 *
 * This means that acquiring the object can't use a simple atomic increment; it
 * has to use a compare-and-swap loop to ensure that it doesn't try to increment
 * an object with a zero refcount. That's still leagues better than a real lock,
 * though, and release can be a single atomic decrement.
 *
 * It also means that threads modifying the cache need to take a lock, to
 * prevent other threads from writing to it concurrently.
 *
 * It's possible for an object currently in use (by a waiter) to be closed and
 * the same handle immediately reallocated to a different object. This should be
 * a very rare situation, and in that case we simply don't cache the handle.

 *              iOS-Madeira ml970: ONE spin governor, for Sleep(0) AND
 *                                 for SwitchToThread
 *
 * HISTORY.  ml950 discovered that a 32-bit D3D9 title spins on Sleep(0) and
 * gave it a pause/yield ladder; ml951 turned the periodic yield into a bounded
 * futex park once a streak was unambiguously a spin; ml960 made the park
 * length escalate (10/50/200 us at streaks 512/4096/32768) because one rung
 * was still 33 k syscalls/s.  All three tuned the SMALLER of this process's
 * two spins.
 *
 * ml970 MEASUREMENT (log 46: 10 min of the same title at 40-60 fps; per 10 s
 * [srv-stats] window, 20 windows):
 *
 *     sleep0   = 1.27 - 2.01 M     (127 - 201 k Sleep(0)/s)
 *     park     = 108 - 196 k       ( 11 -  20 k futex parks/s -- the ladder)
 *     yield_sc = 8.2  - 14.3 M     (0.8 - 1.4 M sched_yield/s)   <-- the find
 *
 * and [prof] localises the yields to a single thread:
 *
 *     swtch_pri     <- Madeira`NtYieldExecution+0x28    13.9 - 15.2 % of ALL CPU
 *       kern by thread: -> tid=00c0 = 100 %             (one thread, no others)
 *     __ulock_wait2 <- Madeira`NtDelayExecution+0x3f4    6.6 -  8.6 %
 *     swtch_pri     <- Madeira`NtDelayExecution+0x410    2.8 -  3.7 %
 *
 * The two NtDelayExecution entries ARE the old ladder: ios_delay_zero is
 * inlined into NtDelayExecution, so both its park and its yield carry
 * NtDelayExecution return addresses.  NtYieldExecution+0x28 therefore cannot
 * be the ladder -- it is the EXPORTED entry point, i.e. callers from outside
 * this file.  There are only three: win32u's message pump (ml940, hard-capped
 * at 5 k/s), server_wait's zero-timeout poll streak (the whole process issues
 * 3.7 k server requests/s, so at most that), and the guest's own
 * SwitchToThread through wow64.  The ladder can account for at most ~60 k of
 * the 11.5 M yields in a window.  So ~99.5 % of 1.15 M sched_yield/s is ONE
 * 32-bit guest thread -- the render thread -- calling SwitchToThread in a spin
 * loop, and it had no throttle of any kind: every call was a syscall.  That is
 * 7x more Sleep(0)-equivalent spinning than Sleep(0) itself, and it is the
 * single largest kernel entry in the process.
 *
 * WHAT THE OLD LADDER GOT WRONG, besides missing that caller.  Its rungs are
 * indexed by CALL COUNT, so how deep a spinner gets depends on how fast its
 * loop happens to iterate, not on how long it has been waiting: a tight
 * SwitchToThread loop reaches rung 3 in microseconds while a loop with real
 * work between polls never leaves rung 0.  And its syscall rate is
 * 1-in-IOS_SLEEP0_YIELD_EVERY *calls*, which is a rate the ladder cannot bound
 * -- 1.15 M calls/s at 1-in-8 would still be 144 k syscalls/s.
 *
 * THE POLICY.  Index everything by ELAPSED SPIN TIME, and bound the KERNEL
 * ENTRY RATE directly instead of the call rate:
 *
 *   - between kernel entries the thread spins in userspace with an `isb sy'
 *     pause whose length doubles every 8 calls (8 -> 256 isb, ~100 ns -> ~3 us).
 *     A userspace poll adds NO handoff latency and costs no syscall, which is
 *     exactly the trade a spin-wait wants; the reason to leave userspace at all
 *     is fairness, not latency.
 *   - the thread enters the kernel at most once per GAP, where GAP grows with
 *     how long this streak has already run:
 *
 *         spun <  50 us : gap  20 us     park  15 us
 *         spun < 500 us : gap 100 us     park  15 us
 *         spun <   5 ms : gap 300 us     park  30 us
 *         spun >=  5 ms : gap 500 us     park  60 us
 *
 *     so a permanently spinning thread costs 1/500 us = 2 k syscalls/s, and the
 *     two spinning threads in this workload cost ~4 k/s together (target: 5 k).
 *   - the FIRST kernel entry of a streak is a real sched_yield(), every later
 *     one is a bounded futex park.  An isolated SwitchToThread or Sleep(0) --
 *     one that is pacing, not spinning -- therefore still performs a real,
 *     immediate yield, byte for byte the old semantics; only the 2nd and later
 *     calls of a back-to-back streak are governed.
 *   - PARK LENGTH IS DELIBERATELY SHORT and does NOT grow to fill the gap.
 *     The park exists to hand the core to whoever we are waiting for, not to
 *     sleep through the handoff: a 15-60 us park inside a 500 us gap means the
 *     probability that the peer's progress lands inside a park at all is
 *     60/500 = 12 %, so the ADDED handoff latency is 0 at the p50 and <= 60 us
 *     at the p88 -- against the old ladder's 200 us park reached after a
 *     quarter second of spinning.  The 1 ms hard cap the brief asks for is
 *     IOS_SPIN_PARK_MAX_NS below; nothing in the table comes near it.
 *
 * WHY IT STILL CANNOT LIVELOCK.  The classic failure is two guest threads on
 * one core where A polls a flag only B can set.  Rung 0's gap is 20 us, so a
 * brand-new streak reaches the kernel within 20 us of starting and A's first
 * kernel entry is a real yield; after that every kernel entry is a park, which
 * is a genuine deschedule, not a hint a loaded scheduler may ignore.  The
 * invariant is therefore stronger than the old ladder's: no governed thread
 * ever spins more than 500 us of wall time without descheduling, at ANY rung
 * and at any loop rate, where the old one only promised "every 8th call".
 *
 * PER-CALL-SITE LEARNING.  The brief asks for the streak distribution keyed by
 * the guest RIP.  That key is not cheaply available here and would be a lie if
 * it were: the wow64 CPU area's Eip is only valid after FEX flushes its JIT
 * state into it (see Context::FlushThreadStateContext), which is itself a
 * server round trip, and the unix-side return address is the syscall
 * dispatcher for every 32-bit caller alike.  What IS free and, on this
 * workload, equivalent is a PER-THREAD estimator: each spinning thread has one
 * dominant spin site (tid 00c0 is 100 % of the yields).  So the governor keeps
 * an EWMA of this thread's finished streak durations and, when history says
 * this thread's spins run long, starts one rung in instead of paying the
 * cheap-rung syscalls again -- the "park length that would have covered ~80 %
 * of past streaks" idea, applied to the gap rather than the park because the
 * gap is what the syscall rate is a function of.  The FULL distribution goes
 * to the log as `[sleep0] hist:' (ios_spin_hist.h) so the next capture either
 * justifies these constants or replaces them; if it shows several distinct
 * modes per thread, that is the evidence that a real per-site key is worth its
 * cost, and not before.

/* iOS-Madeira ml998: THE DEEP RUNGS WERE SPINNING, NOT PARKING.
 *
 * `gap' is the minimum time between kernel entries and `park' is how long the
 * thread is descheduled at each one, so the fraction of a streak this thread
 * is NOT burning a core is park/gap.  The ml970 tables read as an escalation
 * but they are the opposite of one:
 *
 *      rung 0   park 15 us / gap  20 us  =  75 % parked
 *      rung 1   park 15 us / gap 100 us  =  15 % parked
 *      rung 2   park 30 us / gap 300 us  =  10 % parked
 *      rung 3   park 60 us / gap 500 us  =  12 % parked
 *
 * The longer the spin had already run -- that is, the more certain it was that
 * this thread had nothing to do -- the larger the share of the time it spent
 * in ios_cpu_pause() burning the core.  The escalation removed SYSCALLS, but
 * the syscall is the only part of a rung that gives the CPU back, so removing
 * it removed the saving and kept the cost.
 *
 * What that cost, measured: [prof] names `ios_spin_governor+0x320' -- the ISB
 * delay loop -- as the single hottest PC in the process in almost every
 * 10 s window of the qp4.txt capture, at 23.6-31.7 % of all CPU mid-game and
 * 50.6-60.8 % during level loads, more than the JIT and more than the file
 * lookups.  [sleep0] explains why: 2.6 M governed calls per 10 s window from
 * ~500 streaks, i.e. ~2 us of ISB per call for the entire length of a streak.
 *
 * The retune sets park just under gap on every rung, so a thread that is
 * waiting is parked ~95 % of the time instead of ~10 %.  It is exactly the
 * same ladder and the same policy; only the duty cycle changes.
 *
 * The latency this costs is bounded by the rung's park length, and [sleep0]'s
 * own distribution says what that is worth: `hist us' puts 96 % of finished
 * streaks at >= 2 ms and the p50 time-to-progress at 8 ms with p80 at 16 ms,
 * with fewer than 5 % finishing under 1 ms.  So the deepest rung's 380 us
 * granularity is under 5 % of the median wait it applies to, against giving
 * back ~0.7 of a core.  The short rungs stay short precisely because a spin
 * that has not yet run 500 us might still be a genuine quick handoff.
 *
 * The syscall rate barely moves, which is the part worth being explicit
 * about: the gaps shrank by only ~20 %, so a p50 8 ms streak still takes on
 * the order of 25 kernel entries rather than the ~22 it took before.  What
 * changes is what those entries do with the time between them -- ~7.5 ms of
 * the 8 ms is now spent descheduled instead of ~1 ms.  [srv-stats] `park'
 * should therefore read ~3.0-3.2 k/s where it read ~2.5 k/s, while [sleep0]
 * `sleep0'+`yield' collapse from ~2.6 M per 10 s window to ~130 k, because a
 * parked thread is not calling the governor at all.
 *
 * Unchanged: the first kernel entry of a streak is still a real sched_yield(),
 * so Sleep(0)/SwitchToThread keeps its Windows-observable semantics, and
 * IOS_SPIN_PARK_MAX_NS still caps every park at 1 ms. */
